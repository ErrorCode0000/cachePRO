Sorry it is in beta now! (cachePRO 1.0 BETA 2) It's just for macOS at the moment! cachePRO uses the commands in readme.md echo figlet, curl, toilet, sh, read, sudo, rm, echo, if, sleep don't forget to chmod 755 cachePRO to make it openable! It can make your device slower temporary but be sure your device will be faster. Our team is considering making the app PAID once the BETA versions are finished.
Used commands:
sleep
echo

figlet
shopt
